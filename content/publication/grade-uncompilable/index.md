abstract = "We present the first approach to grade uncompilable codes and provide semantic feedback on them using machine learning. We propose two methods that allow us to derive informative semantic features from programs. One of this approach makes the program compilable by correcting errors, while the other relaxes syntax/grammar rules to help parse uncompilable codes. We compare the relative efficacy of these approaches towards grading. We finally combine them to build an algorithm which rivals the accuracy of experts in grading programs. Additionally, we show that the models learned for compilable codes can be reused for uncompilable codes. We present a case study, where a company is able to hire more efficiently by deploying our technology."
