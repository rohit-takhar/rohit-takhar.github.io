      <description>Apart from all functionalities of standard FTP, the important thing on which I have worked is to increase the downloading speed of very large files using multithreading(used POSIX threads).
For very large files, multiple threads are created and each thread creates an instruction connection and data connection with the server. Each thread downloads a specific chunk of data and then all are combined together to get the file.
Note: Use only for very large files because creating and managing threads is also an overhead for CPU.</description>
