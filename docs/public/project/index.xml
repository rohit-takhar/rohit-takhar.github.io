      <description>OSAVA visualizes the different types of algorithms used in operating systems as given in Silberschatz et al. (2012). OSAVA has six modules each dedicated to a particular type of algorithm. A module asks the user to select one of the algorithms available in it and enter relevant information. The module displays a brief description of the selected algorithm and then simulates its working. Output is provided typically as a combination of text and illustrations.</description>

      <title>Multi-segmented FTP client</title>

      <description>Apart from all functionalities of standard FTP, the important thing on which I have worked is to increase the downloading speed of very large files using multithreading(used POSIX threads).
For very large files, multiple threads are created and each thread creates an instruction connection and data connection with the server. Each thread downloads a specific chunk of data and then all are combined together to get the file.
Note: Use only for very large files because creating and managing threads is also an overhead for CPU.</description>
